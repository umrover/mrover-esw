TODO

- fix concurrency bugs in the driver, logger implementation
        -   check if buffer will overflow from http bottleneck (http posts to influx are handled synchronously)
        -   see if read needs to be non-blocking (fcntl)

- integrate "dbc_runtime.hpp"
        -   on start, create all the needed CanMessageDescription for each message.
        -   maybe create a dir for valid dbc files and parse each one (rather than use command line arguments to dbc file names)
        -   it seems that dbc_runtime.hpp implements encode, decode for a can message, but you need to know which message this is. (is there a way to find the id of a can message before) (yes)

        -   fix start function to decode using parser.
        -   fix the Logger class to have parser, helper methods.

- testing
        - implement basic unit tests to test each module
        - stress test the initial can logger to see if any can frames are dropped.
