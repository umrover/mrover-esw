# Brushed DC Motors

We used brushed DC motors for various mechanisms on our rover.
For example, on our robotic arm, we use a 24V brushed motor for joint B
and a 12V brushed motor for the gripper.

Current information about our brushed motor controller (BMC) can be found
on the ESW Google Drive in `projects/brushed-motor-controller-26` ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TxtbWJUpcLVBtVtj82RpuE8Irl_cduapGyJcjrrCujo/edit?usp=drive_link)).
