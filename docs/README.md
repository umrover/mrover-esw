# ESW Documentation

These docs are served using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and are built from the source files in this repository.

In order to test the docs locally, you must first install mkdocs:

```bash
pip install mkdocs
```

Then, you can run the following command to start a local server:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```
