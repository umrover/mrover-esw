# ESW Documentation

These docs are served using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and are built from the source files in this repository.

In order to test and build the docs locally, you must first install mkdocs and plugins. These dependencies are
included in the `tools/venv` virtual environment.

Then, you can run the following command in the root directory of the repo (where `mkdocs.yml` is located)
to start a local server:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```
