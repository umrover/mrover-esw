# Introduction

Welcome to MRover Embedded Software! The Getting Started section is designed to get you up and
running as smooth as possible. It consists of three starter projects to help you get experience with
using microcontrollers and communication protocols. There is also useful information linked below
to supplement the starter projects.

## Starter Projects
All new members are asked to complete the following:

1. [Install STM32CubeIDE](stm32cubeide/index.md)
2. [Starter Project - Part 1: LED](starter/led/index.md)
3. [Starter Project - Part 2: Servo](starter/servo/index.md)

As everyone comes from varying levels of experience, extra information is provided in these docs to
assist the learning process. Please do not hesitate to ask for help!
